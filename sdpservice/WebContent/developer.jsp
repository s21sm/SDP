			Friends and vegans for over 20 years, our founders Andre and Greg asked themselves a simple question – 
			why was there no dairy-free option that delivered the bubbly, stretchy gooeyness of dairy cheese?
			With decent culinary skills and a desire to try, the two set out to create a solution. 
			After two years of mistakes, meltdowns and minor catastrophes, their perseverance paid off. 
			Daiya Cheddar Style and Mozzarella Style Shreds debuted in 2009 at the Natural Products Expo West in Anaheim, California – the event where innovation gets noticed. 
			Consumers raved, and the dairy-free cheese category was changed forever.
